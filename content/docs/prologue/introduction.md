Making analytical tools for Real Time Communication (RTC) is fun! However it is challenging. You need to consider strict time limitations of real-time streams, and tightly integrate services that can report to your monitoring solutions with micro second accuracy.

Here is how ObserveRTC comes into the picture. We make RTC development fun and easy using open-source tools. ObserveRTC aims to provide client side integrations, infrastructure and monitoring tools to observe and analyse WebRTC applications.

### What is WebRTC?

> With WebRTC, you can add real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard. It supports video, voice, and generic data to be sent between peers, allowing developers to build powerful voice- and video-communication solutions. The technology is available on all modern browsers as well as on native clients for all major platforms

### What is WebRTC Stats?

> Audio, video, or data packets transmitted over a peer-connection can be lost, and experience varying amounts of network delay. A web application implementing WebRTC expects to monitor the performance of the underlying network and media pipeline.

### Why ObserveRTC?

* **Open-source** - No hidden magic, no secret souce, it is a transparent monitoring solution for everyone.
* **Own your data** - By deploying it you have full ownership of data from your applications and run further analysis.
* **Designed for the cloud** - When the size of your memory and compute requirements increase, new resources can be dynamically added to your cluster to scale elastically. e.g. hazelcast as an in-memory distributed databse for resiliance.

### What are the benefits?

 * **Performance tuning** - Ability to debug/improve your WebRTC applications.
 * **Regression analysis** - Quantify the impact of changes you made.
 * **System operations** - Measure and monitor the performance of your application.
 * **Troubleshooting & debugging** - Investigate technical issues.
 * **Usage trends** - Track/Understand how your app is used.

### Use cases

 * As an **application developer** you can use ObserveRTC to debug your WebRTC applications.
 * As a **product owner** you can use ObserveRTC to measure and monitor the performance of your application.
 * As an **operations team member** you can monitor the health and get critical alerts about your application.
