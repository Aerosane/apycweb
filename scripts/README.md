Scripts are created to make life easier when docs and other stuffs have to bundle together from different sources

All scripts are designed to run inside this `scripts` directory, and that can be crucial, becasue the move of the files are relative.

Install requirements: 
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`, 

Run script:
    
    `python fetch_sources.py`
